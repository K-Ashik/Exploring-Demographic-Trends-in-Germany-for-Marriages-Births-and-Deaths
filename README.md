# Exploring Demographic Trends in Germany

## Overview

This project explores the demographic trends in Germany, focusing on marriage, birth, and death statistics from 1950 to 2022. The analysis aims to uncover insights into the changing societal dynamics and their implications on the demographic landscape of Germany.

## Data Sources

The analysis utilizes public datasets from the Federal Statistical Office of Germany. The datasets provide comprehensive information on marriages, births, and deaths, allowing for a detailed exploration of trends over the years.

- Marriage Statistics
- Birth Statistics
- Death Statistics

## Key Insights

- Declining Marriage Rates: The analysis reveals a steady decline in marriage rates over the decades, with notable shifts observed in different age groups.
- Changing Birth Patterns: Birth statistics depict changes in birth rates and trends in childbirth patterns, reflecting evolving societal norms and economic factors.
- Mortality Trends: Examination of death statistics highlights trends in mortality rates and disparities across gender and age groups.

## Methodology

The analysis involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling, and visualization techniques to uncover patterns and insights in the data. Python programming language and libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn are utilized for data analysis and visualization.
